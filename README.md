Uhh I had a simple index to make a website where people post what they think is their #1favorite YouTube video of all time and write a small blurb why. Would have to have a sign up so you can't spam since the single submission is the most important part. Seems like a good place to go to if you're ever looking for inspiration or into discovering what's important to other people
